<h1>Assignment: Books - CRUD</h1>
<h2>Update and Delete</h2>
In this assignment, you will be implementing the update and delete methods and test the endpoints with Postman. Continue using the same mvc project that we have been using so far. Here is some controller code to get you started.

<h2>Show</h2>
In this assignment, you will continue to build our CRUD web application by implementing the show method. For example, when the user visits '/books/1', you are to respond with a view page that has all the information about a specific book.

<h2>Delete</h2>
We already created the delete button in the show page of each book. All we have to do is implement the destroy action in our controller.
